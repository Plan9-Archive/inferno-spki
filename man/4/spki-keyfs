.SH NAME
keyfs \- encrypted storage of SPKI keys and certificates
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B spki/keyfs
[
.B -D

[
.B -m mountpoint
]
[
.B -n nvramfile
]
[
.I keyfile
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Keyfs
serves a namespace for storing SPKI keys and certificates. This data is stored in
.I keyfile
(default:
.BR /keydb/spki),
encrypted by a master key using AES
(see
.IR keyring-crypt (2)).
.I Keyfs
should be started only on the machine acting as authentication server (signer),
before a listener is started for
.IR signer (8).
Note that
.I signer
and
.I keyfs
must share the name space.
Furthermore, no other application except the console should see that name space.
.PP
.I Keyfs
prompts for the master key, reads and decrypts
.IR keyfile,
and serves files representing the contents at
.I mountpoint
in the name space (default:
.BR /mnt/keys ).
.PP
Public keys, private keys and certificates read from this file are represented
by the
.IB pk / name,
.IB sk / name,
and
.IB cred / name
directories within 
.I mountpoint. 
The
.I pk
directory
shows all public keys, the
.I sk
directory shows all private keys, and the
.I cred 
directory shows details of all keys and certificates, grouped by name.
.PP
Each directory in 
.I pk
has the following files:
.TF pk
.TP
.B key
The public key, represented as an S-expression.
.TP
.B alg
The algorithm used for the key.
.PD
.PP
Each directory in
.I sk
has the following files:
.TF sk
.TP
.B key
The private key, represented as an S-expression.
.TP
.B alg
The algorithm used for the key.
.PD
.PP
Each directory in
.I cred
may have the following files:
.TF cred
.TP
.B cert
The full SPKI certificate, if one with that name exists, represented as an
S-expression.
.TP
.B issuer
The name of the principal that issued the certificate.
.TP
.B subject
The subject of the certificate.
.TP 
.B type
The type of the key or certificate, either 
.B public key,
.B secret key,
or
.B cert.
.TP
.B tag
An S-expression representing the authority granted by the certificate.
.TP
.B valid
An optional restriction on the certificate's validity.
.TP
.B transport
The certificate in transport form.
.TP
.B signed
.PD
.PP
Additionally, the following files are present in the 
.I mountpoint
directory:
.TF new
.TP
.B new
Allows new keys and certificates to be added to the store. Writing
.I name=S-exp
to this file, where
.I name
is the desired name for the key or certificate and
.I S-exp 
is an S-expression representing it, adds the key or certificate to the store. If
the name already exists, an error is returned.
.PD
.PP
To remove a key, remove the corresponding directory in
.I pk
or 
.I sk.
Removing a directory in
.I cred
removes all keys and certificates of that name from the store. Similarly, keys
and certificates can be renamed by renaming directories.
.PP
All changes made via file system operations in 
.I mountpoint
result in appropriate changes to
.IR keyfile.
.PD
.PP
The
.B -D
option enables tracing of the file service protocol, for debugging.
