.TH VERIFYFS 4
.SH NAME
verifyfs - a verifier for SPKI proof sequences
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B spki/verifyfs
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Verifyfs
serves a single file (default:
.BR /mnt/spki/verify),
which accepts SPKI proof sequences in the form of a list of S-expressions
representing SPKI keys and certificates. When a proof sequence is written to the
file, it attempts to verify it.
.PD
.PP
If the sequence is valid, an Inferno certificate can then be read from the file
which can be used to access Inferno services. If an error occurs, the write
fails and the error is returned to the user.
